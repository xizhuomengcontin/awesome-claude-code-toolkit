| `notification-log.js` | Notification | Log notifications for later review |
| `prompt-check.js` | UserPromptSubmit | Detect vague prompts, suggest clarification |

### Related SDKs

If you prefer a typed, npm-installable foundation for writing hooks rather than raw scripts:

- [claude-code-hooks](https://github.com/Payshak/claude-code-hooks) — TypeScript SDK with `defineHook()`, typed event payloads for all 5 hook events, response builders, and unit-testable `.handle()` method. Zero dependencies.
- [EchoCoding](https://github.com/launsion-boop/EchoCoding) — Audio layer for coding agents with hook-triggered SFX, ambient soundscape, and optional cloud TTS/ASR voice interaction. Works with Claude Code hooks and also supports Cursor/Windsurf, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.

### Installing Hooks

```bash
cp hooks/hooks.json .claude/hooks.json
cp -r hooks/scripts/ .claude/hooks/scripts/
```

### Quick Setup with cc-safe-setup

Install 8 production-tested safety hooks in one command — destructive command blocker, branch push protection, secret leak prevention, syntax validation, and more:

```bash
npx cc-safe-setup
```

Includes `--audit` (score your setup 0-100), `--scan` (detect tech stack, recommend hooks), and `--verify` (test each hook). See [cc-safe-setup](https://github.com/yurukusa/cc-safe-setup) for details.

### GateGuard — Fact-Forcing PreToolUse Gate

Install a `PreToolUse` gate that blocks Edit/Write/Bash on first attempt, demanding investigation (importers, schemas, user instruction) before allowing. A/B tested: **+2.25 quality improvement**. Works as a standalone gate or alongside existing PreToolUse hooks — Claude Code runs all matching hooks in registration order, so GateGuard complements rather than replaces other guards.

```bash
pip install gateguard-ai
gateguard install
```

See [GateGuard](https://github.com/zunoworks/gateguard) | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gateguard-ai/) for details. By [ZUNO WORKS K.K.](https://github.com/zunoworks)
